Hawk used a regular expression to parse `Host` HTTP header (`Hawk.utils.parseHost()`), which was subject to regular expression DoS attack - meaning each added character in the attacker\u0027s input increases the computation time exponentially. `parseHost()` was patched in `9.0.1` to use built-in `URL` class to parse hostname instead. `Hawk.authenticate()` accepts `options` argument. If that contains `host` and `port`, those would be used instead of a call to `utils.parseHost()`.","cvssScore":7.5,"cvssVector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","cwe":"CWE-400","cve":"CVE-2022-29167","reference":"https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2022-29167?component-type\u003dnpm\u0026component-name\u003dhawk\u0026utm_source\u003ddependency-check\u0026utm_medium\u003dintegration\u0026utm_content\u003d7.1.1","externalReferences":["http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\u003dCVE-2022-29167","https://github.com/mozilla/hawk/pull/286","https://github.com/mozilla/hawk/security/advisories/GHSA-44pw-h2cw-w3vq"]}]}
