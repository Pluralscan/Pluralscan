Pluralscan is a source code analysis software, that's combine the best features of open sources security tools into a single solution. 
- Software Composition Analysis aka SCA
- Static Application Security Testing aka [SAST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_application_security_testing)
- Dynamic Application Security Testing aka [DAST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_application_security_testing)
- Code Quality Analysis with [Linter's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software))
- Active security testing with [Fuzzing Tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing)
- Prevents unwanted law complication by checking open source **license compliance**
- Benchmark results provided by different tools
- ...

## WARNING

Pluralscan should be currently considered as a **POC/POW project** that try to demonstrate how to realize a complexe business oriented software in Python by following **Domain Driven Design concepts**.

## Features

- Fetch open-source projects from **various locations** *(Git, Github, Gitlab, Disk...)*.
- Fetch software packages built with **various packaging systems** *(pip, poetry, npm, pip, cargo, go...)*
- Plan code analysis batch on a package with **various analyzers** *(Roslyn, Sonar, Security Code Scan...)*.
- Centralize and persist analysis reports into a **generic business model representation**.
- Monitor and provide assistance to reduce technical debt.

## Roadmap from June 2022 to December 2022

![Pluralscan Roadmap](docs/Pluralscan-Roadmap.png)

## Getting started with Docker

### docker-compose

Setup a complete stack with MongoDB, Redis and Pluralscan. (Known issue with analyzer execution, fix comming soon)
```bash
docker-compose up
```

Remove containers.
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Check Redis

- Navigate to http://localhost:8001
- Accept RedisInsight license.
- Login with the password defined inside `.docker.env`

### Check Mongo

- Navigate to http://localhost:

### Check Apache Solr

- Navigate to http://localhost:8983

## Stack Overview

### Core Developement

- **Python 3.10** as language and runtime environment.
- [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#coroutine) to declare coroutines and execute concurrent code
- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for packaging and dependency management.
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/) framework for testing.
- [pytest-cov](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html)
- [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) for static type checking.

#### Recommendation

- Use [pathlib]() for handling cross-platform file path.

### Backend Web Application (API)

- **Python 3.10*** as language and runtime environment.
- [FastApi]() is used as web framework used for API and serving SPA.
- [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#coroutine) is used to declare coroutines and execute concurrent code.
- [esdbclient](https://github.com/pyeventsourcing/esdbclient) as gRPC client for EventStoreDB.
- [Celery]()
- [python-kafka]()
- [grpcio]()
- [grpcio-tools]()
- [pymongo]()
- [sse-starlette]() for performs Server Sent Event.
- [uvicorn]()
- [pydantic]()

### Front-end Web Application

- **NodeJS 16.13.0** as runtime environment.
- **Typescript** as main language.
- [Svelte 3](https://svelte.dev/) as front-end framework.
- [Carbon Design System for Svelte](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-svelte) as design framework. 
- [jest](https://jestjs.io/fr/) as testing framework.
- [ts-jest](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest) for writing tests in Typescript.
- [svelte-jester](https://github.com/svelteness/svelte-jester) for precompile svelte components before importing them in to tests.
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) as utility css framework.
- [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/) used to sync data from CouchDB Server on client device for offline usage.

### Commandline CLI Application

- **Python 3.10*** as language and runtime environment
- [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#coroutine) to declare coroutines and execute concurrent code

## Development

### IDE

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Commandline

TODO.

### Web Application

#### Pluralscan TS Api Client

```bash
cd pluralscan-api-client
npm install
npm run build
```

#### **Svelte (Single Page Application)**

##### Install

```bash
cd pluralscan-svelte
npm install
```

##### Run Svelte Rollup Dev Server (Hot Reloading)

```bash
cd pluralscan-svelte
npm run dev
```

##### Build and upgrade front-end libs (until npm)

###### Powershell
```powershell
cd pluralscan-svelte
npm run build
```

The build process will output directly into  the API project.

##### Check

To verifiy if the project is error free, you can use the CLI tool svelte-check. It acts like an editor asking for errors against all of .svelte files.

```bash
npx svelte-check
```

##### Debug

From VS Code Debug View, run the "Debug FastApi" profile for start a dev web service with debuging.

## Tests
